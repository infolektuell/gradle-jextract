Libraries can be quite large, and maybe you're not going to use every symbol in it.
Jextract offers a [filtering] mechanism for generating partial library bindings that include only the explicitly requested symbols.
See [Filtering] in the Jextract guide for more information.

:::tip
Avoiding dead code is a best practice, so filtering is recommended if applicable.
:::

This plugin supports two approaches to implement filtering per library.

- Using a dedicated arg file is the more Jextract-idiomatic way.
- Putting the symbols in the plugin's DSL is a quick convenience alternative with a bit more help from the IDE.
