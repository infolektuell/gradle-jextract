The DSL extension offers a `version` property that can be configured with a `JavaLanguageVersion` to define which version should be used.
The plugin downloads and installs Jextract from the [official release page][jextract].
It selects the best Jextract distribution for the configured version and current native platform.

## Use Java toolchain (highly recommended)

By convention, the plugin tries to infer the version from the configured Java toolchain.
This is by far the most convenient and reliable method for most projects.

:::caution[modern JDK]
Your target JVM should be of version 19 or above.

<Tabs syncKey="dsl">
<TabItem label="Kotlin">

```kotlin gradle dsl "languageVersion"
// build.gradle.kts
java {
    toolchain {
        languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(24)
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Groovy">

```groovy gradle dsl "languageVersion"
// build.gradle
java {
    toolchain {
        languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of 24
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
This will choose Jextract 22, because this is still the latest release.
:::

## Use another version

Setting a version in the DSL will override the convention, and the Java toolchain will be ignored.
This might make sense if no Java plugin is used in the build, or if the version should diverge from the target JVM.

:::caution[Compatibility]
Please ensure that Jextract and the JVM target of your code are compatible. The major version of Jextract shouldn't be higher than that of the target JVM version.
