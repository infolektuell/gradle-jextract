In most situations, no additional configuration is needed.
The plugin will download and use Jextract automatically.
It is preconfigured with the most convenient approach, selecting Jextract depending on the target JVM toolchain from your Java build.
So having configured a sensible Java toolchain (version 19 and above) will be sufficient.

For more specific needs, it offers flexible configuration options to customize the used Jextract distribution.
There are two modes to choose from:

- Use a defined Jextract version that will be downnloaded and installed
- Use a local Jextract installation

Each approach has its strengths and downsides and offers varying convenience.
