Kotlin JVM uses the Java source sets, so Kotlin will find the generated sources.
So adding them like in pure Java projects is sufficient.

See [Using in Java code](../java/) for instructions.

## Using with Kotlin Multiplatform

Kotlin Multiplatform is able to build for a JVM target, but it creates source sets that are named differently than those from the Java plugin.
The main source set is named `jvmMain` in KMP.
The bindings are added as follows:

<Tabs syncKey="dsl">
<TabItem label="Kotlin">

```kts {6-8}
// build.gradle.kts
jextract.libraries {
    val greeting by registering {
        // library config
    }
    sourceSets.named("jvmMain") {
        jextract.libraries.addLater(greeting)
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Groovy">

```groovy {6-8}
// build.gradle.kts
jextract.libraries {
    def greeting = register('greeting') {
        // library config
    }
    sourceSets.named("jvmMain") {
        jextract.libraries.addLater(greeting)
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
The `addLater` method prevents creating the library config objects during configuration phase by adding providers to list properties.
